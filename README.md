# sonatype-nexus-repository-bulk-import
If you're new to Nexus or want to migrate and will be using Nexus 3, this script will help you import your repository to Nexus. This script has been tested using Sonatype Nexus Repository OSS 3.58.1-02 and will upload my Maven Repository, which is usually located at your ~/.m2/repository.

Simply update the script based on your needs and set the permissions. I'm using chmod 755 script.sh. Then run ./scripth.sh.
